# Scheduling Algorithms

## Objective
The objetive of this code is to learn and analyze the most common and basic scheduling algorithms presented in operating systems class whose is a obligatory subject in computer science course at UFRJ.

## Description
The algorithms implemented are: 
- First Come, First Served (FCFS)
- Round-Robin (RR)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Coopertative Priority (PRIOc)
- Preemptive Priority (PRIOp)
- Dynamic Priority (PRIOd)

The program receives the tasks information through an .txt file called "entry.txt". This file contains the number of tasks (first line), the tasks' duration (second line), its time of arrival (third line) e priority (fourth line). This order of each information in each line must be followed. Based on these information, the program calculates, for each algorithm, the tasks' total medium time of execution, total medium time of wait and the number of context switching.

## Using the code
To run this code you'll just need to get Python installed. I used Python 3.x to write the code, so I think that if you use 2.x version, you have to make some changes in the code.

## Built with
- Windows 10 
- IDLE (Python 3.5.2)
- Python language
