# Scheduling Algorithms

## Objetive
The objetive of this code is to learn and analyze the most common and basic scheduling algorithms presented in operating systems class whose is a obligatory subject in computer science course at UFRJ.

## Description
The algorithms implemented are: 
- First Come, First Served (FCFS)
- Round-Robin (RR)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
- Coopertative Priority (PRIOc)
- Preemptive Priority (PRIOp)
- Dynamic Priority (PRIOd)

The program receives the tasks information through an .txt file called "entry.txt". This file contains the tasks' duration, its time of arrival e priority. Based on these information, the program calculates, for each algorithm, the tasks' total medium time of execution, total medium time of wait and the number of context switching.

## Using the code
To run this code you'll just need to get Python installed. I used Python 3.x to write the code, so I think that if you use 2.x version, you have to make some changes in the code.

## Built with
- Windows 10 
- IDLE (Python 3.5.2)
- Python language
